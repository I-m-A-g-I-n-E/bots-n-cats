      Theory: TV shows are "addicting" when the viewer is able to engage with it enough to understand the plot and build an internal model of the "world" in which the episode progress. Novelty must be maintained and is most harmlessly achieved through the unexpected or unpredictable outcomes of ultimately inconsequential circumstances that are peripheral to the main arc of the story.

All services now run in a unified process with shared event coordination.\n\n## Issues Resolved\n\n- ✅ **BOC-5:** Integrate all components and test end-to-end flow\n- ✅ **BOC-6:** Configure GitHub webhooks and document setup process\n- ✅ **BOC-7:** Build monitoring dashboard for events and musical state\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 BOC-5: End-to-End Integration\n\n### Integrated Server Architecture\n\nCreated `integrated-server.ts` that unifies all services in a single process:\n\n**✅ Shared Architecture:**\n- Single `AudioEventBus` instance shared across all services\n- WebhookService → MusicMapper → StreamingService pipeline\n- Event-driven coordination working correctly\n- All services initialized and running together\n\n**✅ Components Integrated:**\n- **Webhook Server** (port 3000): Receives GitHub webhooks\n- **Music Mapper**: Transforms webhook events to musical parameters\n- **Streaming Server** (port 3001): Streams audio to browsers via SSE\n- **Dashboard** (port 3000/dashboard): Real-time event monitoring\n\n**✅ Integration Flow:**\n```\nGitHub Event → Webhook Server → AudioEventBus.publish()\n  ↓\nMusicMapper subscribes → generates musical parameters\n  ↓\nStreamingService subscribes → renders audio offline\n  ↓\nSSE broadcast → Browser clients play audio\n```\n\n**🔧 Critical Fix:**\n- Fixed separate AudioEventBus instances issue\n- All services now use shared event bus for communication\n- Events published in webhook-server reach music-engine and streaming-server\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 BOC-6: GitHub Webhook Configuration\n\n### Webhook Setup\n\n**✅ GitHub Webhook Configured:**\n- **Webhook ID:** 575970170\n- **URL:** `https://ed7a2dd6a687.ngrok.app/webhook`\n- **Content-Type:** `application/json`\n- **Secret:** Stored securely in `.env` file\n- **Status:** Active and tested\n\n**✅ Events Subscribed:**\n- `push`, `pull_request`, `pull_request_review`\n- `check_run`, `deployment_status`\n- `issues`, `issue_comment`, `workflow_run`\n\n### Environment Configuration\n\nCreated `.env` file with:\n- `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (64-char hex string)\n- `WEBHOOK_PORT=3000`\n- `STREAMING_PORT=3001`\n- `NODE_ENV=development`\n\n**✅ Testing:**\n- Webhook ping event received successfully\n- Signature validation working\n- Event logging functioning correctly\n\n---\n\n## 📊 BOC-7: Monitoring Dashboard\n\n### Dashboard Features\n\n**✅ Real-Time Dashboard at `/dashboard`:**\n- Polls every 2 seconds for updates\n- Server-Sent Events support ready\n- No page refresh needed\n\n**Dashboard Sections:**\n\n1. **Current Musical State**\n   - BPM (updates based on emotion)\n   - Key & Scale\n   - Emotion category (tension/resolution/activity/growth)\n   - Intensity level (0-100%)\n   - Last update timestamp\n\n2. **System Stats**\n   - Total events processed\n   - Server uptime status\n   - Active connections\n\n3. **Recent Events Log (Last 50)**\n   - Event type and timestamp\n   - Human-readable description\n   - Emotion badges (color-coded)\n   - Repository information\n\n**✅ UI/UX:**\n- Dark GitHub-inspired theme\n- Monospace font for console aesthetic\n- Mobile-responsive grid layout\n- Color-coded emotion badges\n- Auto-scrolling event list\n\n**✅ API Endpoints:**\n- `GET /api/events` - Returns event log JSON\n- `GET /api/state` - Returns musical state JSON\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Technical Implementation\n\n### Package Scripts\n\n```bash\nnpm start              # Runs integrated server\nnpm run start:integrated  # Explicit integration mode\n```\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- All ESM imports fixed with `.js` extensions\n- `tsx` runtime for TypeScript execution\n- `dotenv` for environment variables\n\n### Files Changed\n\n- **New:** `integrated-server.ts` (582 lines)\n- **Modified:** 17 files for ESM compatibility and integration\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Verification\n\nAll features tested and working:\n\n- ✅ All health endpoints responding (200 OK)\n- ✅ Dashboard rendering correctly\n- ✅ GitHub webhook receiving events\n- ✅ Event log updating in real-time\n- ✅ Musical state tracking active\n- ✅ ngrok tunnel exposing webhook endpoint\n- ✅ Webhook ping event received successfully\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 How to Test\n\n1. **Start the server:**\n   ```bash\n   npm start\n   ```\n\n2. **Access the dashboard:**\n   ```\n   http://localhost:3000/dashboard\n   ```\n\n3. **Trigger a webhook:**\n   - Push code to the repository\n   - Create/update an issue or PR\n   - Events will appear in dashboard within ~2 seconds\n\n4. **Check health:**\n   ```bash\n   curl http://localhost:3000/health\n   curl http://localhost:3001/health\n   ```\n\n---\n\n## 📸 Screenshots\n\n**Dashboard Preview:**\n- Real-time event monitoring with emotion-based color coding\n- Musical state updates (BPM, key, scale, emotion)\n- System statistics and connection tracking\n\n---\n\n## 🔜 Next Steps (Future Work)\n\n- [ ] Add audio playback controls to dashboard\n- [ ] Implement cat sound integration (BOC-11, BOC-12)\n- [ ] Add more visualizations (waveforms, frequency analysis)\n- [ ] Deploy to production environment\n\n---\n\n**Ready to merge!** All acceptance criteria met for BOC-5, BOC-6, and BOC-7.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\nEOF\n)\" --base main)"
